Some thoughts for further development:
--------------------------------------

- Run without backend support
- Refactor scripts/main.js and test/test-main.js, too much duplicate code
- Master API data is loaded only after user has logged in to system
- Integrate 3rd party sign-in (separate route, pass parameters to backend)
